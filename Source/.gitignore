# Here you can specify files to ignore when adding files to the depot.
#
# - Files are specified in local syntax
# - a # character at the beginning of a line denotes a comment
# - a ! character at the beginning of a line excludes the file specification
# - a * wildcard matches substrings.
#
# For example:
# 
# foo.txt    Ignore files called "foo.txt"
# *.exe      Ignore all executables
# !bar.exe   Exclude bar.exe from being ignored
